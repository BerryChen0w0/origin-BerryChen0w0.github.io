Hello World! I'm Berry. I would like to post my notes while studying zero knowledge proofs, as well as other knowledge of interest. Hopefully, my blogs could be helpful to the readers.

The first site of me was launched with the help of <a href="https://jmcglone.com/guides/github-pages/">Hank Quinlan's tutorial</a> on April 11st, 2024. Thank him a lot!

On May 6th, 2024, I updated the site with a new theme of jekyll -- minima. I also build a local jekyll environment on my computer so that I can test my GitHub Page site locally with Jekyll. <a href="https://zhuanlan.zhihu.com/p/672713591">This tutorial</a> helped me on that.
